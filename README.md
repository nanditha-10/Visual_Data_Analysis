#Visual Data Analysis in Python
===============================
A comprehensive exploration of data visualization techniques, from simple distributions to advanced dimensionality reduction methods.

#Overview
=========
This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Python. It covers univariate, multivariate, and whole-dataset visualizations. The implementation utilizes popular libraries like matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for insightful data exploration and representation.

#Dataset
========
The dataset used for this project includes a mix of quantitative, categorical, and binary features. It is well-suited for demonstrating different types of visualizations.


#Implemented Techniques : 
========================

1. Univariate visualization

2.1 Quantitative features
  
  > Histograms and density plots
    
  > Box plot
    
  > Violin plot
    
  > describe()

2.2 Categorical and binary features

  > Frequency table

  > Bar plot

3. Multivariate visualization

3.1 Quantitative vs. Quantitative

  > Correlation matrix
      
  > Scatter plot
      
  > Scatterplot matrix

3.2 Quantitative vs. Categorical

3.3 Categorical vs. Categorical

  > Contingency table

4. Whole dataset visualizations

    4.1 A naive approach
